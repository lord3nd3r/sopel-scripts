# Trivia Game Framework

IRC-style trivia game with categories, progressive hints, and inactivity detection.

## Features

- **187 questions** across 18 categories (Geography, Science, History, Movies, Sports, etc.)
- **Progressive masked hints** (e.g., `isra** *** ******` → `israel a** ******` → `israel a** ***dan`)
- **Per-channel game state** - multiple channels can play simultaneously
- **Streak tracking** and scoring with point bonuses for fast answers
- **Inactivity detection** - warns after 3 unanswered, stops after 5
- **IRC-bot-style output** matching traditional trivia bot format

}
```

```

## Game Behavior

### Hints & Timing
- Question is displayed
- 3 progressive hints shown at 10-second intervals
- Final 10-second wait before timeout (40 seconds total per question)
- Answer any time before "Time's up!" message

### Scoring
- **Fast answer** (< 5 seconds): 3 points
- **Medium answer** (5-10 seconds): 2 points  
- **Slow answer** (10+ seconds): 1 point
- **Streak bonus**: Same player answering consecutively increases streak counter

### Inactivity Protection
- After **3 unanswered questions**: Warning message displayed
- After **5 unanswered questions**: Game automatically stops
- Answering any question resets the inactivity counter

## Next Steps

- Add more questions to `questions.json`
- Implement persistent leaderboards (SQLite database)
- Add difficulty levels or category selection commands
- Implement weekly/monthly championship tracking
- Add custom time limits per category
- Create question submission system for users
