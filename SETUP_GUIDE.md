## 🔧 Customization

### Change Hint Timing
Edit `trivia.py`, line ~85:
```python
time.sleep(10)  # Change to 5 for faster hints
```

### Adjust Point System
Edit `trivia.py`, lines ~118-122:
```python
if elapsed < 5:
    points = 3  # Fast answer
elif elapsed < 10:
    points = 2  # Medium
```

### Add More Questions
Edit `questions.json` following this format:
```json
{
  "category": "Your Category",
  "question": "Your question?",
  "answer": "your answer"
}
```

## 📊 Question Database

- **187 questions** across 18 categories
- Categories: Geography, Science, History, Movies, Sports, Music, Food, Animals, Literature, Technology, Math, Art, Culture, Languages, Tools, Word Play, TV Film and Stage, Sport and Leisure

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Bot doesn't respond to $trivia:**
- Check that trivia.py is in the scripts directory
- Verify command prefix is `$` (check bot config)
- Try: `/msg BotName reload trivia`

**"questions.json not found" error:**
- Ensure questions.json is in same directory as trivia.py
- Check file permissions: `ls -la questions.json`

**Game doesn't stop after inactivity:**
- This is normal - timing may vary based on server load
- Manually stop with `$strivia`
