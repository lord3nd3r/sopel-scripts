# 🧩 Trivia (trivia)

Multi-player trivia with categories, progressive hints, streaks, and stats.

---

## Setup

**1. Place all required files in the scripts directory:**
```
~/.sopel/scripts/trivia.py
~/.sopel/scripts/trivia_game.py      # game engine
~/.sopel/scripts/trivia_db.py        # database layer
~/.sopel/scripts/questions.json      # question bank
```

**No config section needed.** The trivia database (`trivia_stats.db`) is created automatically in the scripts directory on first use. Questions are loaded from `questions.json`.

## Features

- **465 questions** across 18+ categories (Geography, Science, History, Movies, Sports, etc.)
- **Anti-repeat rotation**: Questions answered in the channel's last 3 finished games are automatically deprioritized to the back of the deck on game start so consecutive games stay fresh.
- **Progressive hints**:
  - Text answers reveal letters progressively at 10-second intervals.
  - Purely numeric answers (years, counts) receive progressive meta-hints (number indicator $\to$ magnitude range $\to$ decade or upper/lower half) rather than bare asterisks.
  - Single-character answers are explicitly identified as single letters.
- **Streaks & scoring**: Fast answers award bonus points, and consecutive correct answers build player streaks.
- **Inactivity protection**: Warns after 3 unanswered questions and automatically stops after 5.
