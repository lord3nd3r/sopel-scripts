# 🧠 AI Chatbot (ai-multi)

Talks to you when mentioned by name. Supports xAI Grok, local Ollama, and OpenAI-compatible APIs, with optional Grok web search. **v6.0** — memory-safe, proper lifecycle, thread-safe caches.

---

## Setup

**1. Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install requests
```

**2. Add to your ibot `.cfg` file (e.g. `~/ibot/glitchy.cfg`):**
```ini
[ai_multi]
# Required when using Grok chat or search (get one from https://console.x.ai)
api_key = xai-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

# Chat backend: grok (default), ollama, or openai
chat_backend = grok

# Search backend: grok (default) or none
search_backend = grok

# Grok model (default: grok-4.3)
model = grok-4.3

# Ollama settings (when chat_backend = ollama)
ollama_url = http://localhost:11434
ollama_model = llama3.2

# OpenAI-compatible settings (when chat_backend = openai)
openai_api_key =
openai_base_url = https://api.openai.com/v1
openai_model = gpt-4o

# Optional — custom system prompt (the bot's personality)
system_prompt = You are Glitchy, a regular in this IRC channel. You're sharp, geeky, and a little sarcastic.

# Optional — channels where the bot will NOT respond
blocked_channels =
    #quiet-room
    #no-bots

# Optional — nicks the bot will completely ignore
banned_nicks =
    SpamBot
    AnnoyingUser

# Optional — nicks ignored in conversation (no replies, but still tracked)
ignored_nicks =
    LogBot

# Optional — how to detect if a mention is directed at the bot
# Choices: heuristic (default), off, model
#   heuristic — skip third-person / "about the bot" mentions
#   off       — respond to any nick mention
#   model     — not implemented; falls back to heuristic
intent_check = heuristic
```

**Personality (natural language to the bot):** defaults to **per-user**.  
Channel-wide (`in this channel` / `for everyone`) requires **op or bot admin**.

**3. Place the script in your ibot plugin extra directory:**
```
~/.sopel/scripts/ai-multi.py
```

> **Note:** The bot runs on [ibot](https://github.com/lord3nd3r/ibot), a custom asyncio IRC framework with a Sopel-compatible shim. Per-channel system prompts can be set via `grok_channel_prompts.json` in the scripts directory. Set `search_backend = none` when using a local backend without Grok search.

## Commands

### Talk to the Bot

| Command | Who | Description |
|---------|-----|-------------|
| `BotNick: <message>` | Anyone | Talk to the bot |
| `/me pets BotNick` | Anyone | Emote interaction |
| `BotNick: remember <fact>` | Anyone | Save a fact permanently to SQLite |
| `BotNick: forget <fact>` | Anyone | Remove a saved fact (fuzzy match) |
| `BotNick: forget everything` | Anyone | Clear all your saved facts |
| `BotNick: what do you remember about me` | Anyone | List all your saved facts |
| `$grokreset` | Anyone | Reset your conversation history (not permanent facts) |
| `$grokreset channel` | Op+ / Admin | Reset all channel conversation history |
| `$ai <on\|off>` | Op+ / Admin | Enable/disable AI entirely for the channel |
| `$talkback <on\|off>` | Op+ / Admin | Enable/disable unprompted chime-ins |
| `$testemote` | Anyone | Test that the emote plugin is loaded |

### Admin PM Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `$join #channel [key]` | Make bot join a channel |
| `$part #channel` | Make bot leave a channel |
| `$ignore <nick>` | Add nick to ignore list |
| `$unignore <nick>` | Remove nick from ignore list |

### 🔍 Moderation: Schizo Check

AI-powered chat analysis for channel moderation. Scans recent messages for incoherent, delusional, or conspiratorial content.

| Command | Who | Description |
|---------|-----|-------------|
| `$scheck` | Op+ / Admin | Scan last 100 messages from all users (in channel) |
| `$scheck <nick>` | Op+ / Admin | Scan only that user's messages (in channel) |
| `$scheck #channel [nick]` | Admin | Scan from PM (no channel visibility) |
| `$skick <nick> <#channel>` | Op+ / Admin | Kick user from channel |
| `$skban <nick> <#channel>` | Op+ / Admin | Kick-ban user from channel |

**How it works:**
1. Op/admin runs `$scheck` or `$scheck SomeUser`
2. Bot sends "Scanning..." confirmation
3. AI analyzes the messages and PMs results to the requester
4. If a user was targeted, PM includes `$skick` / `$skban` action commands
5. Op can run the action to kick or kickban

> **Note:** Results are always sent via PM, never in the channel. PM mode (`$scheck #channel nick`) is admin-only.

---

## 🔍 Web Search (Automatic)

The bot **automatically** uses live web search when it detects that your question is about something time-sensitive or factual. There is no special command — just ask naturally and the bot decides whether to search.

**Trigger keywords** (any of these in your message activates search):

| Category | Keywords |
|----------|----------|
| News & Events | `news`, `latest`, `recent`, `today`, `yesterday`, `tonight`, `this week`, `this month`, `current events`, `headlines`, `breaking`, `update` |
| Sports | `score`, `results`, `standings`, `who won`, `who is winning` |
| Finance | `stock price`, `price of`, `worth`, `market`, `stock`, `stocks`, `crypto`, `bitcoin`, `btc`, `ethereum`, `eth` |
| Weather & Disasters | `weather`, `forecast`, `drought`, `flooding`, `hurricane`, `tornado`, `earthquake`, `wildfire` |
| People & Events | `who died`, `who is`, `is ___ dead`, `did ___ happen`, `election`, `poll` |
| Factual Queries | `what is`, `where is`, `when is/was/did`, `how many/much/long/far/old/tall/big/fast`, `how bad`, `how severe`, `status of`, `population`, `gdp`, `economy`, `inflation`, `interest rate` |
| Temporal | `currently`, `right now`, `at the moment` |
| General | `search`, `whats happening`, `tell me about`, `what do you know about`, `look up`, `find out` |

**Examples:**
```
Grok: what's the latest news today?
Grok: who won the NBA game last night?
Grok: what's the stock price of AAPL?
Grok: what is the price of bitcoin?
Grok: how bad is the drought in Florida?
Grok: search for the election results
Grok: what's the weather forecast for tomorrow?
Grok: tell me about the latest earthquake
```

> **Note:** If the web search API fails, the bot automatically falls back to answering from its training data.

> **Safety net:** If the model attempts to call a tool that wasn't provided (outputting raw XML), the bot automatically strips the garbage, retries the request with web search enabled, and returns a real answer. If the retry also fails, it tells the user to try again instead of outputting gibberish.

### Asking for Sources

You can ask the bot to include source links in its response:

```
Grok: what's the latest news? show me the links
Grok: search for election results with sources
```

**Trigger phrases:** `show me the links`, `sources`, `citations`, `references`, `urls`, `include links`

> **Note:** The bot uses a strict extraction system that queries the API for genuine deep-link article URLs to prevent hallucinations. It does not output raw links mid-sentence; instead, it generates a clean list of verified, clickable sources at the end of its response.

---

## 🎭 Dynamic Personalities (Roleplay)

You can change the bot's personality dynamically in conversation. In channels, these commands change the personality **channel-wide** by default, unless you explicitly request it only for yourself.

### Setting a Personality

Set a new roleplay style or persona:

| Format | Scope | Example |
|--------|-------|---------|
| `BotNick: reply as a <vibe>` | Channel-wide | `Grok: reply as a drunken pirate` |
| `BotNick: from now on be <vibe>` | Channel-wide | `Grok: from now on be a grumpy wizard` |
| `BotNick: reply to me as a <vibe>` | Per-user | `Grok: reply to me as a helpful butler` |
| `BotNick: speak to <nick> like <vibe>` | Target user | `Grok: speak to burnout like a drill sergeant` |

The bot will acknowledge the change, e.g. `ok, new channel-wide personality: drunken pirate` or `ok, new personality for User: helpful butler`.

### Resetting Personality

Clear any dynamic personalities and return the bot to its default configuration:

- `BotNick: reset personality`
- `BotNick: stop acting`
- `BotNick: be yourself`

---

## 🕐 Time & Date Queries

Ask the bot about the current time or date and it responds **instantly with the exact time** from your saved timezone preferences — no AI involved, no jokes, just the real answer. Time queries **bypass rate-limiting** so you can always get a fresh answer.

**Trigger phrases:**
- `what time is it`, `what's the time`, `current time`
- `what's the date`, `what day is it`, `today's date`

**Examples:**
```
Grok: what time is it?
Grok: what's today's date?
Grok: what day is it?
```

> **Note:** Short time queries (≤8 words) go directly to a local clock response. Longer messages that happen to mention time still go through the AI.

### Setting Your Timezone

Tell the bot your timezone and it will remember it for all future time queries:

| Method | Example |
|--------|---------|
| Tell the bot | `Grok: I'm in EST` |
| Explicit set | `Grok: set my timezone to CST` |
| Natural phrasing | `Grok: I live in Pacific` |

**Supported abbreviations:** `EST` / `EDT` / `ET` / `Eastern`, `CST` / `CDT` / `CT` / `Central`, `MST` / `MDT` / `MT` / `Mountain`, `PST` / `PDT` / `PT` / `Pacific`, `UTC` / `GMT`

### Setting Your Time Format

Prefer 12-hour or 24-hour time? Tell the bot:

```
Grok: I prefer 12hr
Grok: use 24 hour
```

Preferences are saved in the database and persist across restarts.

---

## 🧠 Persistent Memory (Remember / Forget)

Tell the bot to remember facts about you — they're stored permanently in SQLite and included in every AI context, so the bot always knows them. Facts survive restarts, rehashes, and conversation resets.

### Saving Facts

```
Grok: remember I live in Florida
Grok: remember my favorite color is blue
Grok: remember if I ask what does florida man say, reply with ┌ಠ_ಠ)┌∩
Grok: remember ComputerTech is the sheep shagger
```

The bot confirms with a short response like "got it, I'll remember that" or "noted".

### Removing Facts

```
Grok: forget about Florida           → fuzzy matches and removes the fact
Grok: forget everything              → clears ALL your saved facts
```

### Viewing Facts

```
Grok: what do you remember about me
Grok: what do you know about burnout
```

### Limits
- Max **50 facts** per user
- Max **300 characters** per fact
- Facts must be at least **5 characters** (shorter ones pass through to the AI as conversation)
- Duplicate facts are detected and rejected
- Conversational "remember when..." / "remember how..." phrases are NOT treated as commands

> **Note:** `$grokreset` clears conversation history but does NOT touch permanent facts. Use "forget everything" to clear facts.

---

## 💬 Review Mode

Ask the bot to summarize or give its opinion on what's been discussed in the channel. Channel messages are **persisted to the database** so review mode survives bot restarts.

**Trigger phrases:**
- `thoughts`, `opinion`, `what do you think`
- `summarize`, `give me your take`, `opine`
- `what's being discussed`, `what's happening`, `what's going on`
- `catch me up`, `fill me in`, `what did I miss`
- `recap`, `tldr`, `tl;dr`, `what happened`
- `^^` (shorthand)

**Examples:**
```
Grok: what do you think?
Grok: catch me up, what did I miss?
Grok: tldr
```

> **Cooldown:** Review mode has a 30-second cooldown per channel to prevent spam.

---

## 🤗 Emote Interactions

The bot reacts to `/me` actions and emote-style messages directed at it. Responses are **generated dynamically by the AI** and vary each time.

| Action | Example Trigger |
|--------|-----------------|
| pet / pat | `/me pets Grok` |
| hug / cuddle / snuggle | `/me hugs Grok` |
| poke / boop | `/me pokes Grok` |
| kiss | `/me kisses Grok` |
| slap / smack | `/me slaps Grok` |
| highfive | `/me highfives Grok` |
| wave / wink / dance / twirl | `/me waves at Grok` |

**Trigger formats:**
```
/me pets Grok
* User hugs Grok
```

---

## 🧑 Humanization Features

The bot includes several features designed to make it feel less like an AI and more like a regular channel participant.

### Typing Delay

Responses are delayed by a random **1.5–4 seconds** before being sent, simulating the time a real person would take to read and type a reply. This prevents the instant-response pattern that's a dead giveaway for bots.

**Tunables** (in code):
| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `TYPING_DELAY_MIN` | 1.5 | Minimum delay in seconds |
| `TYPING_DELAY_MAX` | 4.0 | Maximum delay in seconds |

### Unprompted Chime-In

The bot occasionally jumps into conversation **without being mentioned**, just like a real channel regular would. It reads the recent chat context and drops a short, natural reaction — a quip, agreement, one-liner, or just "lol".

**How it works:**
- Every channel message has a **5% chance** of triggering a chime-in
- Messages containing laughter/excitement keywords (lol, lmao, omg, wtf, etc.) get a **3x boost** (15% chance)
- **200-second cooldown** per channel between chime-ins
- Requires at least **5 messages** in the channel log before it will chime in
- Chime-in responses are typically short (under 100 chars)
- **Greeting filter** — short greetings directed at other users (e.g. "hey owo", "yo burnout") are automatically excluded from chime-in

**Tunables** (in code):
| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `CHIMEIN_ENABLED` | `True` | Master switch |
| `CHIMEIN_CHANCE_PCT` | 5 | Base % chance per message |
| `CHIMEIN_COOLDOWN` | 200 | Seconds between chime-ins per channel |
| `CHIMEIN_MIN_ACTIVITY` | 5 | Min messages in log before chiming in |

**Channel Control:**
Channel operators can toggle this feature per-channel using:
- `$talkback off` — Disable unprompted chime-ins
- `$talkback on` — Enable unprompted chime-ins

### Natural Language Style

The system prompt instructs the bot to:
- Use lowercase naturally, like IRC regulars do
- Drop in casual filler: "lol", "ngl", "tbh", "lmao", "fr", "honestly"
- Use sentence fragments instead of always giving complete answers
- Occasionally start with filler words: "oh", "wait", "hmm", "yo", "dude"
- Give one-word reactions ("same", "fr", "lmao") when that's all the moment needs
- Be blunt, funny, or deadpan depending on the conversational vibe

## ⚙️ Architecture & Internals (v6.0)

This section documents the internal design for developers and maintainers.

### Resource Lifecycle

| Phase | What happens |
|-------|--------------|
| `setup(bot)` | Reads API key from raw configparser (bypasses ibot's `***` mask), creates a `requests.Session` with connection pooling (10/20 pool), initializes all `bot.memory` structures, wraps `bot.say`, starts 3 worker threads |
| `shutdown(bot)` | Sets `API_WORKER_SHUTDOWN`, sends poison pills to workers, drains the queue, closes the `requests.Session`, restores `bot.say` to its original function |

On **plugin reload**, `setup()` automatically closes any previous session before creating a new one, and guards against `bot.say` wrapper stacking via `hasattr(bot, '_grok_original_say')`.

### Memory Management

All ephemeral per-message and per-user data uses `_BoundedTTLCache` — a thread-safe dict with automatic TTL expiration and capacity limits:

| Cache | Maxsize | TTL | Purpose |
|-------|---------|-----|----------|
| `grok_dedup_cache` | 2,000 | 2s | Prevents duplicate PRIVMSG handler invocations |
| `grok_user_last_cache` | 5,000 | 5min | Per-user safety rate limiter |

Long-lived structures like `grok_history`, `grok_locks`, and `grok_channel_log` are bounded by the number of active channels/users (not per-message), so they don't grow without bound.

### Threading Model

```
┌─────────────────┐
│ Sopel handler    │──► API_TASK_QUEUE (maxsize=50)
│ threads (N)      │         │
└─────────────────┘         ▼
                     ┌──────────────┐
                     │ Worker Pool  │ (3 daemon threads)
                     │ _api_worker()│
                     └──────────────┘
                            │
                     ┌──────────────┐
                     │ Background   │ (learning, scheck)
                     │ Semaphore(2) │ ← limits concurrent bg tasks
                     └──────────────┘
```

- **Worker tasks** are `dict` objects with named keys (not positional tuples) for type safety
- **Background tasks** (fact learning, scheck analysis) are gated by `_BG_TASK_SEMAPHORE(2)` to prevent thread exhaustion
- All SQLite access goes through `_DBContext`, which opens a fresh connection per operation in WAL mode

### Security

- API key is read from the raw configparser and set on the session's `Authorization` header once. **Never** logged (only key presence and length are logged).
- All utility functions (`_extract_facts_from_conversation`, `_scheck_worker`, `test_api`) use `bot.memory['grok_session']` instead of reading `bot.config.grok.api_key` (which returns `***` through the ibot shim).
- The debug response file write has been removed — no API responses are written to disk.

### Database

- SQLite3 in WAL mode (`journal_mode=WAL`) for concurrent read support
- `_DBContext` context manager ensures connections are committed/rolled back and closed
- Nested connections are avoided — `_db_approve_suggestion` defers its profile write until after the suggestion connection closes

### Configuration

|---------|------|---------|-------------|
| `api_key` | string | — | xAI API key when Grok chat or search is enabled |
