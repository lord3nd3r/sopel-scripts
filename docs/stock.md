## How It Works

1. **Ticker lookup**: Tries the input as a direct ticker symbol first (e.g. `AAPL`).
2. **Name fallback**: If that fails, searches by company name and grabs the first matching ticker.
3. **Multi-period trends**: Calculates percentage change for **5 time periods**: 24h, 7d, 30d, 6m, and 1y.
4. **Trend indicators**: Each period gets a colored emoji:
   - 🟢 — price went **up** in that period
   - 🔴 — price went **down** in that period
   - ⚪ — data not available for that period

### Output Format

```
📈 Company Name (TICKER)  💵 $PRICE  🟢24h +X.XX%  🔴7d -X.XX%  🟢30d +X.XX%  🟢6m +X.XX%  🟢1y +X.XX%
```

The currency symbol adapts to the stock's market (e.g. `$` for USD, `€` for EUR, `£` for GBP). Prices include thousands separators.
