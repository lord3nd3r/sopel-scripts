# 💰 Coins & Mugging (mug)

IRC economy game with coins, mugging, bounties, a shop, and gambling.

---

## Setup

**1. Place the script:**
```
~/.sopel/scripts/mug.py
```

**2. Add to your Sopel `.cfg` file (optional):**
```ini
[mug_game]
# Enable or disable the mug game (default: true)
enabled = true
```

**Data storage:** Game data (balances, bounties, high scores, etc.) is stored in Sopel's built-in `bot.db` — no extra database setup needed.

> **Auto-Voice:** Users with 500+ coins automatically get `+v` in channels where the bot has ops. This is built-in and requires no extra config.

## Notes

- **Auto-Voice:** Users with ≥500 coins automatically receive `+v` in configured channels. Drops below 500 = devoiced. Ops/hops/owners are exempt.
- **High Score Topic:** When a player beats the all-time high score, the bot automatically updates the channel topic in configured channels (default: `#mug`). The high score appears at the end of the topic as `┃ 🏆 High Score: nick (X coins) 👑`. If the marker is missing (e.g. after a manual topic change), it self-heals on the next data save.
