# 🛡️ Anti-Spam Protection (antispam)

Anti-Spam Kick Protection for Sopel. It detects and kicks users who post rapid-fire messages, unicode art walls, or repetitive copypasta spam. This plugin issues **kicks only (no bans)**, and integrates with the **autovoice** plugin to revoke voice privileges from kicked spammers.

---

## Setup

**1. Place the script:**
```
~/.sopel/scripts/antispam.py
```

**2. Logs:**
Anti-spam actions and debug info are written to a dedicated log file:
```
~/.sopel/antispam.log
```

**Note:** Antispam is **disabled by default per channel**. Use `$spam on` to enable.

## Detection Modes

The plugin uses five layers of spam detection:

1. **Rate-Based Detection**:
   * Kicks if a user sends $\ge$ `threshold` messages (default: 5) within a `window` of seconds (default: 8).
2. **Content-Based Detection**:
   * Instant kick if a message contains a configured trigger phrase (exact match, case-insensitive).
3. **Unicode Art Detection**:
   * Detects blocks of braille or drawing characters (e.g. text art walls).
   * Kicks if a user sends $\ge$ `unicode_threshold` lines (default: 3) of unicode art within a `unicode_window` (default: 30s).
4. **Copypasta Fingerprinting**:
   * Strips formatting, punctuation, and URLs to create a normalized shingle fingerprint (3 words per shingle).
   * When a user is kicked for rate-based or AI spam, their messages are "learned" in the database.
   * Future messages matching $\ge$ 40% of the learned shingles are instantly kicked.
5. **Grok AI Classification**:
   * Uses `grok-3-mini-fast` to classify a user's recent messages (last 5+ messages in a 300s window) as `SPAM` or `SAFE`.
   * Specifically trained to allow normal offensive language, trolling, and crude humor, while targeting repetitive walls of text, quoted articles, or URL dumps.
   * Rate-limited to one check per user per 10 seconds.

## Autovoice Revocation

To prevent spammers from exploiting the auto-voice system (which grants `+v` to active users), a kick triggers an automatic reset of the user's autovoice progress. They must re-earn their voice from zero.

## Exemptions

### Privilege-Based
Channel halfops (`%`) and above (ops `@`, admins `&`, owners `~`) are **automatically exempt** from all spam kicks. Voiced (`+v`) users are **not** exempt.

### User Exemptions
Add specific users to a per-channel exempt list. Useful for bots that might trigger rate-based detection (e.g. game bots, relay bots):
```
$spam exempt add DuckHunt
$spam exempt add Trivia_Bot
```

### Command Prefix Exemptions
Exempt messages starting with a specific command prefix. Useful for game commands that users may send rapidly (e.g. duckhunt):
```
$spam cmdexempt add !bang
$spam cmdexempt add !befriend
$spam cmdexempt add !duck
```
Messages starting with an exempt prefix are completely skipped by all spam detection modes — they won't count toward rate limits, won't trigger content matches, and won't be fingerprinted as copypasta.
